# chatbogpt

chatbot GPT is loosely based on the old COBE chatbox (https://github.com/peileppe/cobe-journal)

An actualized implementation of a chatbox using chatGPT (because we are in 2023)

To run the program a file named "apikey.txt" must exist

this file requires an "api token" from openai

This implementation will run via the terminal, and write a journal.txt after each conversation

For a fancier implementaiton check this chatGPT running via Terminal version
